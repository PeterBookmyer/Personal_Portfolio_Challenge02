Personal Portfolio Challenge 02

For this project, we were tasked with creating a personal portfolio to highlight our work throughout class as well as some information about ourselves and contact info. The purpose is to inform potential employers or network connections about my work and who I am. My motivation is to help drive oppurtunities following bootcamp. I learned a ton, mostly via google and past class activities.

Versions:

I started by hand drawing out a wire frame mock up, this was loosely based off the horiseon website in Student Challenge 01. It was very easy to use that as a guide, however once I started building out the basic html and css, I realized it looked too similar. Back to the drawing board! I then created a whole new, more simple, yet elegent design completely from scratch. This is the result!

Usage:

Pretty simple! Use the navigation links in the top right to navigate to each section. Scroll thru sections and learn about my work or about me. Hover over images to see effects. Click on links at the bottom to navigate to external sites.
